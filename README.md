# portapi
a wrapper for the Port Connect API, built into a discord bot

Early stages with limited functionality, but it works, and is currently running off a docker container,
of which I've not included any config or environment files for.

It is 100% compatible with the aiohttp library, however due to the fact it'll primarily be receiving 
usage from two people, in one discord server, it's really not necessary.

Not intended for adoption, updates, or public use. Just look at it.
